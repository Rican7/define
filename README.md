## Install

Pre-compiled binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/Rican7/define/releases) page.

If you have a working Go environment, you can install via `go get`:

```shell
go get github.com/Rican7/define
```


## Configuration

The **define** app allows configuration through multiple means. You can either set configuration via:

- Command line flags (good for one-off use)
- A configuration file (good for your "dotfiles")
- Environment variables (especially useful for API keys)


### Command line flags

The list of command line flags is easily discovered via the `--help` flag. Any passed command line flag will take precedence over any other configuration mechanism.

### Configuration file

A configuration file can be stored at `~/.define.conf.json` and **define** will automatically load the values specified there.

To print the default values of the configuration, simply use the `--print-config` flag. This can also be used to initialize a configuration file, for example:

```shell
define --print-config > ~/.define.conf.json
```

### Environment variables

Some configuration values can also be specified via environment variables. This is especially useful for API keys of different sources.

The following environment variables are read by **define**'s sources:

- `MERRIAM_WEBSTER_DICTIONARY_APP_KEY`
- `OXFORD_DICTIONARY_APP_ID`
- `OXFORD_DICTIONARY_APP_KEY`


## Sources

The **define** app has access to multiple sources, however some of them require user-specific API keys, due to usage limitations.

You can specify a preferred source either via the command line flag `--preferred-source="..."` or in your configuration file. For more information, see the section on [Configuration](#configuration).

### Obtaining API keys

The following are links to register for API keys for the different sources:

- [Merriam-Webster's Dictionary API](https://www.dictionaryapi.com/register/index.htm)
- [Oxford Dictionaries API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/?tag=#plans)
